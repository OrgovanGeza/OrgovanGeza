### I'm Géza, a Technical Manager who fell in love with coding.

- 🏡 I'm currently working as a Servicenow developer.

- 👯 I have worked on a big variety of full-stack projects, and I'm open to cooperate in the future as well!
- 🔭 I'm mainly interested in JS/TS based full-stack development.
- 🔮 In my future I plan to expand my knowledge to mobile development as well.
- 👟 In my free time I like to do some exercise (running, ice-skating), and to organize board-gaming nights.

Fun fact: I solved the greatest mystery of our existence with a single line of JS code:

  Which came first: the chicken or the egg?
  
  console.log(['🥚','🐣','🐤', '🐔' ].sort()) --> [ '🐔', '🐣', '🐤', '🥚' ]
